# Oncology Statistics Course Materials

Educational materials for medical statistics training designed for Scottish oncology trainees preparing for professional examinations.

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive statistical tutorials and practical exercises for:

-   **Clinical Oncology trainees** preparing for the FRCR Part 1 examination
-   **Medical Oncology trainees** preparing for the Specialty Certificate Examination (SCE)

The course assumes **no prior knowledge** of statistics or programming and builds practical data analysis skills using R alongside core statistical concepts.

🔗 **Main course page**: [Oncology Statistics – Edinburgh Cancer Informatics](edin.ac/oncology-statistics/)

## Course Structure

The materials are organized as a series of interactive tutorials covering:

-   Descriptive statistics
-   Survival analysis
-   Study design and hypothesis testing
-   Diagnostic tests and screening
-   Clinical trials methodology
-   Statistical inference

Each tutorial includes: - Real-world medical examples using synthetic Scottish healthcare datasets - Step-by-step R code with explanations - Interactive exercises - FRCR/SCE-style multiple choice questions - Comprehensive solutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   R (version 4.0 or higher)
-   RStudio (recommended)
-   No prior statistics or programming experience required

### Installation

1.  **Clone this repository**:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Edinburgh-Cancer-Informatics/onco-stats.git
    cd [local-file-path].onco-stats
    ```

2.  **Install required packages**: Each tutorial includes a setup script that uses `pak` for reliable package management. Simply run the setup chunk at the beginning of each tutorial.

3.  **Open tutorials**: Tutorials are provided as Quarto (`.qmd`) documents. Open them in RStudio and render to HTML for the best interactive experience.

## Technical Approach

The course materials follow modern R best practices:

-   **Tidyverse workflow** for accessible, readable code
-   **Quarto documents** for reproducible, interactive tutorials
-   **pak package manager** for reliable installation
-   **Excel data files** as starting points (real-world workflow)
-   **Synthetic datasets** based on Scottish healthcare contexts
-   **Hidden code chunks** by default (focus on concepts, reveal code as needed)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tutorials, you will be able to:

-   Understand core statistical concepts relevant to clinical oncology
-   Perform descriptive and inferential statistical analyses in R
-   Interpret survival analysis outputs
-   Critically evaluate clinical research methodology
-   Answer FRCR Part 1 and SCE examination questions on medical statistics
