## Definition
"Statistics is the science of collecting, summarising, presenting and interpreting data, and of using them to estimate the magnitude of associations and test hypotheses."

— Kirkwood and Sterne, *Essential Medical Statistics*

## Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** is concerned with summarising and presenting data. It is an essential step before further analysis is conducted.

It helps form subjective impressions of answers to research questions.

To produce appropriate descriptive statistics requires knowledge of different data types. Broadly, data are either numerical or categorical.

## Inferential Statistics

**Inferential statistics** provides a framework to make subjective impressions more objective by quantifying uncertainty. Through estimation and testing it quantifies the magnitude of associations and indicates the strength of evidence that these are "real".

Statistics is the core science of evidence-based medicine.

## Terminology: Probability

In layman terms probability is often regarded as the degree of belief that an event will happen.

For the most part when statisticians refer to probability (denoted as P or p), they are referring to the **long-term frequency** of an event occurring. This provides a measure of the chance that an event will happen, usually under a set of specific assumptions. The probability of the event not occurring is 1-p.

By definition probability can take any value between 0 (the event will definitely not occur) and 1 (the event will definitely occur).

Probability is sometimes expressed as a percentage 0-100%.
