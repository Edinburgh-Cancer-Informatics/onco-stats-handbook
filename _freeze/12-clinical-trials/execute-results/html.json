They establish dosage, side effects and delivery mechanisms.\n\nA **Phase III trial** is a full evaluation of the new treatment compared to a comparative treatment.\n\nAfter a treatment has been approved and licensed for general use, **Phase IV trials** observe how the treatment works in a non-trial setting, identify long-term effects and rare side effects.\n\n## Control Groups\n\nPhase III trials have at least one **treatment group** and **comparator group** (the control group).\n\n- If the condition under investigation has a **standard treatment**, then this is the treatment that the control group may receive\n- If standard care does not exist, then the control might be given a **placebo** (a treatment which does not consist of an active component) or no treatment if considered ethical\n\nThe purpose of the control group is to quantify the effect of the treatment by comparing the outcome of interest in the control group to the outcome in the treatment group.\n\n## Treatment Allocation (Randomisation)\n\nPatients are usually **randomised** to treatment groups. This is to avoid systematic bias, and ensure that each patient has an equal chance of being allocated to each treatment.\n\n### Methods of Randomisation\n\n\n::: {#tbl-randomisation .cell tbl-cap='Methods of randomisation in clinical trials'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrandomisation <- tibble(\n  Method = c(\"Simple randomisation\", \"Block randomisation\", \n             \"Stratified randomisation\", \"Cluster randomisation\"),\n  Description = c(\n    \"Each patient randomly allocated to treatment (like flipping a coin)\",\n    \"After every x patients, number on each treatment is equal\",\n    \"Block randomisation within important prognostic strata (e.g. age, stage)\",\n    \"Groups/clusters of individuals randomised rather than individuals\"\n  ),\n  Advantage = c(\n    \"Simple to implement\",\n    \"Ensures balanced numbers in each arm\",\n    \"Balances important prognostic factors\",\n    \"Practical when individual randomisation not possible\"\n  )\n)\n\nrandomisation |>\n  kable() |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Method </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Advantage </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Simple randomisation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Each patient randomly allocated to treatment (like flipping a coin) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Simple to implement </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Block randomisation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> After every x patients, number on each treatment is equal </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Ensures balanced numbers in each arm </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Stratified randomisation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Block randomisation within important prognostic strata (e.g. age, stage) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Balances important prognostic factors </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cluster randomisation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Groups/clusters of individuals randomised rather than individuals </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Practical when individual randomisation not possible </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Allocation Concealment (Blinding)\n\nRandomisation is not sufficient to ensure that a trial is unbiased. If outcome assessment is subjective or open to interpretation, systematic bias can be introduced by knowledge of the treatment received.\n\n**Masking** or **blinding** means that people are unaware of the treatment that someone received.\n\n### Levels of Blinding\n\n| Level | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Single blind** | The patient does not know which treatment they have been allocated |\n| **Double blind** | Neither patient nor doctor/evaluator knows which treatment has been allocated |\n| **Triple blind** | Neither the patient, nor the doctor, nor those reviewing the interim results know which treatment the patient has been allocated |\n\n## Designs for Randomised Trials\n\n### Parallel Groups\n\nThe simplest form of randomised trial is a **parallel group trial**. Eligible patients are randomised to two or more groups, treated according to the assigned group, and assessed for their response to treatment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simple diagram\nggplot() +\n  # Population box\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 2, ymin = 2, ymax = 3, \n           fill = \"#3498db\", alpha = 0.3, colour = \"#2980b9\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = 2.5, label = \"Eligible\\nPatients\", size = 4) +\n  \n  # Randomisation\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 3, y = 2.5, label = \"Randomise\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  \n  # Treatment arm\n\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 4, xmax = 6, ymin = 3.2, ymax = 4.2, \n           fill = \"#27ae60\", alpha = 0.3, colour = \"#1e8449\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5, y = 3.7, label = \"Treatment\", size = 4) +\n  \n  # Control arm\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 4, xmax = 6, ymin = 0.8, ymax = 1.8, \n           fill = \"#e74c3c\", alpha = 0.3, colour = \"#c0392b\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5, y = 1.3, label = \"Control\", size = 4) +\n  \n  # Outcome boxes\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 7, xmax = 9, ymin = 3.2, ymax = 4.2, \n           fill = \"#27ae60\", alpha = 0.2, colour = \"#1e8449\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = 3.7, label = \"Assess\\nOutcome\", size = 3.5) +\n  \n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 7, xmax = 9, ymin = 0.8, ymax = 1.8, \n           fill = \"#e74c3c\", alpha = 0.2, colour = \"#c0392b\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = 1.3, label = \"Assess\\nOutcome\", size = 3.5) +\n  \n  # Arrows\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 2, xend = 2.5, y = 2.5, yend = 2.5,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 3.5, xend = 4, y = 2.5, yend = 3.7,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 3.5, xend = 4, y = 2.5, yend = 1.3,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 6, xend = 7, y = 3.7, yend = 3.7,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 6, xend = 7, y = 1.3, yend = 1.3,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  \n  # Compare\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 9, xend = 10, y = 3.7, yend = 2.5,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 9, xend = 10, y = 1.3, yend = 2.5,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10.5, y = 2.5, label = \"Compare\\nOutcomes\", size = 3.5) +\n  \n  theme_void() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.5, 11.5), ylim = c(0, 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Schematic of a parallel group trial design](12-clinical-trials_files/figure-html/fig-parallel-1.png){#fig-parallel width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Factorial Designs\n\nIn a **factorial trial**, two (or more) intervention comparisons are carried out simultaneously.\n\nFor example, in a trial for surgical patients with colorectal cancer, those who participate might be randomised to:\n\n- Receive peri-operative radiotherapy **or not**, AND\n- Receive local regional chemotherapy **or not**\n\nMost factorial trials have two 'factors', each of which has two levels.

This is because the reason why patients do not comply or drop out may be related to the treatment they received.\n\nOne potential solution is called **intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis**. ITT analysis includes every subject who was randomised according to the randomised treatment assignment. It ignores noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomisation.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Key Point\nIn ITT analysis, the estimate of treatment effect will generally be **more conservative** than that found with a per-protocol analysis.\n:::\n\n### Number Needed to Treat (NNT)\n\nThe **NNT** is the number of patients that need to be treated for one patient to benefit from a treatment compared to a control treatment.\n\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\text{Absolute Risk Reduction}}$$\n\nThe **absolute risk reduction** is the risk in control group minus the risk in treatment group.\n\n| NNT | Interpretation |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **1** | Everyone improves with treatment and no one improves with control |\n| **Higher values** | Less effective treatment (more patients need to be treated for one to benefit) |\n\n## Outcome Measures in Oncology Trials\n\n\n::: {#tbl-endpoints .cell tbl-cap='Common outcome measures in oncology clinical trials'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nendpoints <- tibble(\n  Endpoint = c(\"Overall survival (OS)\", \"Progression-free survival (PFS)\", \n               \"Disease-free survival (DFS)\", \"Objective response rate (ORR)\",\n               \"Tumour regression\", \"Quality of life\", \"Toxicity\"),\n  Description = c(\n    \"Time from randomisation to death from any cause\",\n    \"Time from randomisation to progression or death\",\n    \"Time from randomisation to recurrence or death (after curative treatment)\",\n    \"Proportion with complete or partial response\",\n    \"Reduction in tumour size\",\n    \"Patient-reported outcomes on wellbeing\",\n    \"Adverse events and side effects\"\n  )\n)\n\nendpoints |>\n  kable() |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Endpoint </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Overall survival (OS) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Time from randomisation to death from any cause </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Progression-free survival (PFS) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Time from randomisation to progression or death </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disease-free survival (DFS) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Time from randomisation to recurrence or death (after curative treatment) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Objective response rate (ORR) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proportion with complete or partial response </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Tumour regression </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Reduction in tumour size </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Quality of life </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Patient-reported outcomes on wellbeing </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Toxicity </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Adverse events and side effects </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## CONSORT Statement\n\n**CONSORT** stands for **C**onsolidated **S**tandards **o**f **R**eporting **T**rials.
