A solid foundation now will serve you throughout your career.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\n- Statistics helps us make sense of data and draw reliable conclusions\n- Descriptive statistics summarises what we observe\n- Inferential statistics helps us generalise beyond our sample\n- Probability measures the chance of events occurring\n- Understanding statistics is essential for evidence-based oncology practice\n",
