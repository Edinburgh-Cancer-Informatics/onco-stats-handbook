A **population** is the entire group of individuals whose characteristics we are interested in.\n\nThis is achieved by using a '**sample**' of individuals from the entire population.\n\nUsing the sample, we measure a characteristic whose value can vary from individual to individual (a '**variable**') – age, tumour stage, blood pressure, performance status, weight, sex, occupation, and length of survival following radiotherapy are all examples of variables.\n\nThe values observed among individuals within the sample are called **observations** or **data**.\n\nWe summarise the values of the characteristic in the sample (the summary is called the **sample statistic** – for example 'average' age). We then make an inference about the corresponding summary value (called the **population parameter**) in the entire population.\n\nAn important assumption is that the sample is **representative** of the entire population. To achieve this, individuals in the sample must be selected **randomly** from the entire population. Random selection means that every person in the population has the same probability of being selected to the sample.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a visual representation of the inference process\nset.seed(42)\npop_data <- tibble(\n  x = runif(200, 0, 4),\n  y = runif(200, 0, 4)\n)\n\nsample_indices <- sample(1:200, 15)\nsample_data <- pop_data[sample_indices, ]\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = pop_data, aes(x = x, y = y), \n             colour = \"#2c3e50\", size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_point(data = sample_data, aes(x = x + 6, y = y), \n             colour = \"#e74c3c\", size = 3) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = 4.5, label = \"Population\", \n           size = 5, fontface = \"bold\", colour = \"#2c3e50\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = 4.5, label = \"Sample\", \n           size = 5, fontface = \"bold\", colour = \"#e74c3c\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 4.3, xend = 5.7, y = 2.5, yend = 2.5,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, \"cm\")), \n           colour = \"#3498db\", linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5, y = 3, label = \"select random sample\", \n           size = 3.5, colour = \"#3498db\", fontface = \"italic\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 5.7, xend = 4.3, y = 1.5, yend = 1.5,\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, \"cm\")), \n           colour = \"#27ae60\", linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5, y = 1, label = \"Use sample to make an\\ninference about the population\", \n           size = 3, colour = \"#27ae60\", fontface = \"italic\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.5, 10), ylim = c(-0.5, 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Using a sample to make inferences about the population](03-populations-samples_files/figure-html/fig-inference-diagram-1.png){#fig-inference-diagram width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Random Sampling\n\nThe above strategy is called **simple random sampling**. There are other selection strategies, including stratified random sampling and cluster sampling. At their core is random selection, and the notion that we cannot predict which individual will be included in the sample.\n\n| Sampling Method | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| Simple random sampling | Every individual has an equal chance of selection |\n| Stratified random sampling | Population divided into subgroups, then random samples from each |\n| Cluster sampling | Random selection of groups, then study all individuals within selected groups |\n\n## Selection Bias\n\n**Bias** is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction. **Selection bias** is a common type of error. The decision about who to include in a study can throw findings into doubt.\n\nSelection bias can occur when the researcher decides who is going to be studied. It is usually associated with research where the selection of participants isn't random (i.e. with observational studies such as cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies). Random selection helps reduce selection bias by ensuring each individual has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nEven then selection bias occurs when people agree or decline to participate in a study. Those who choose to join (i.e. who self-select into the study) may share a characteristic that makes them different from non-participants.\n\nOften, selection bias is unavoidable. That's why it's important for researchers to examine their study design for this type of bias and find ways to adjust for it, and to acknowledge it in their study report.\n\n## Summary\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| Population | The entire group of individuals whose characteristics we are interested in |\n| Sample | A subset of individuals selected from the population |\n| Variable | A characteristic that varies from individual to individual |\n| Sample statistic | A summary calculated from sample data (e.g. mean age) |\n| Population parameter | The true value in the whole population (usually unknown) |\n| Random selection | Every person has the same probability of being selected |\n| Selection bias | Systematic error from non-representative sample selection |\n",
