This can invalidate study findings.\n:::\n\n### How Selection Bias Occurs\n\nSelection bias can happen when:\n\n- Researchers decide who participates (not random)\n- Certain patients are more likely to agree to participate\n- Some patients are lost to follow-up\n- Inclusion criteria exclude important groups\n\n### Examples in Oncology\n\n| Scenario | Type of Bias | Problem |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| Only patients at major centres included | Referral bias | May have more complex cases |\n| Patients who respond better stay in study | Survival bias | Overestimates treatment benefit |\n| Healthier patients agree to participate | Volunteer bias | Results may not apply to sicker patients |\n\n### Minimising Selection Bias\n\nEven with careful design, some selection bias may be unavoidable. Researchers should:\n\n- Examine their study design for potential bias\n- Adjust for known sources of bias where possible\n- Acknowledge limitations in their reports\n\n## Clinical Application\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Reading Research Papers\nWhen reading a clinical trial, always ask:\n\n1. How were patients selected?\n2. Is the sample representative of your patients?\n3. What exclusion criteria were applied?\n4. How many patients were lost to follow-up?\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\n- A **population** is the entire group we want to learn about\n- A **sample** is a subset we actually study\n- **Random sampling** helps ensure representativeness\n- **Selection bias** can invalidate findings\n- Always consider whether study results apply to your patients\n",
