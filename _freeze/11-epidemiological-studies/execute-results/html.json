These rates are usually **age standardised** to take account of differences in the age structure of the population over time or between places.\n\n## Types of Observational Studies\n\nObservational epidemiological studies fall into three broad groups:\n\n- **Cross-sectional studies**\n- **Cohort studies**\n- **Case-control studies**\n\nThe unit of observation is usually individuals but can also be groups of individuals (for example – different populations defined by a shared geography – these are called **ecological studies**).\n\n- Studies in which the health event of interest has yet to happen are called **prospective**\n- Studies in which the health event has already occurred are called **retrospective**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a visual comparison of study designs\nstudy_designs <- tibble(\n  Design = c(\"Cross-sectional\", \"Cohort\", \"Case-control\"),\n  Direction = c(\"Single time point\", \"Forward in time\", \"Backward in time\"),\n  `Time Frame` = c(\"Present\", \"Prospective\", \"Retrospective\"),\n  `Outcome Measure` = c(\"Prevalence\", \"Incidence/Relative Risk\", \"Odds Ratio\")\n)\n\nstudy_designs |>\n  kable() |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {#fig-study-designs .cell-output-display}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Design </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Direction </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Time Frame </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Outcome Measure </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cross-sectional </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Single time point </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Present </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Prevalence </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cohort </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Forward in time </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Prospective </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Incidence/Relative Risk </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Case-control </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Backward in time </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Retrospective </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Odds Ratio </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\nComparison of epidemiological study designs\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cross-sectional Study\n\nA **cross-sectional study** is carried out at a single point in time. A health survey is a type of cross-sectional study where the aim is to describe health behaviours or health status in a large sample of the population.\n\nA cross-sectional study is suitable for estimating the **prevalence** of a condition in the population.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition\n**Prevalence** is the proportion (or percent) of individuals with a particular condition in the population at a point in time.\n:::\n\n## Cohort Study\n\nA **cohort study** takes a group of individuals and follows them forward in time. These studies are usually prospective.\n\nThe aim is to assess whether exposure to a particular factor affects the **incidence** of disease in the future.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definitions\n**Incidence** is the number of new cases of a condition occurring in a population over a set time period.\n\n**Incidence rate** is the number of new cases divided by the person-time at risk, and is usually expressed in terms of person-years.\n:::\n\n### Analysis of Cohort Studies\n\nThe analysis of cohort studies can be summarised by the ratio of incidence rates in the exposed and non-exposed groups (incidence rate ratios or **relative risk**).\n\n\n::: {#tbl-cohort-table .cell tbl-cap='Structure of a cohort study analysis table'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncohort_table <- tibble(\n  ` ` = c(\"Exposed: Yes\", \"Exposed: No\", \"**Total**\"),\n  `Disease: Yes` = c(\"a\", \"c\", \"a + c\"),\n  `Disease: No` = c(\"b\", \"d\", \"b + d\"),\n  `Total` = c(\"a + b\", \"c + d\", \"n\"),\n  `Incidence Rate` = c(\"a / (a + b)\", \"c / (c + d)\", \"\")\n)\n\ncohort_table |>\n  kable(escape = FALSE) |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">  </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disease: Yes </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disease: No </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Total </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Incidence Rate </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Exposed: Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> b </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a + b </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a / (a + b) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Exposed: No </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> c </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> d </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> c + d </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> c / (c + d) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> **Total** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a + c </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> b + d </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> n </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Relative Risk\n\nThe **relative risk (RR)** indicates the increased (or decreased) risk of disease associated with exposure to the factor of interest.\n\n$$RR = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)}$$\n\n| Relative Risk | Interpretation |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| **> 1** | An increased risk in the exposed group |\n| **= 1** | Risk is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups |\n| **< 1** | A reduced risk in the exposed group |\n\nA relative risk of one indicates that the risk is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups. A relative risk greater than one indicates that there is an increased risk in the exposed group compared with the unexposed group; a relative risk less than one indicates a reduction in the risk of disease in the exposed group.\n\n## Case-Control Study\n\nA **case-control study** compares the characteristics of a group of patients with a particular disease (the cases) to a group of individuals without the disease (the controls), to see whether exposure to a factor occurred more or less frequently in the cases than the controls.\n\nBecause patients are selected on the basis of their disease status, it is **not possible to estimate the risk of disease**. For cases and controls we can estimate the **odds** of being exposed to the risk factor.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-case-control-table .cell tbl-cap='Structure of a case-control study analysis table'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncc_table <- tibble(\n  ` ` = c(\"Exposed: Yes\", \"Exposed: No\", \"**Total**\", \"Odds of exposure\"),\n  `Case (Disease)` = c(\"a\", \"c\", \"a + c\", \"a / c\"),\n  `Control (No Disease)` = c(\"b\", \"d\", \"b + d\", \"b / d\"),\n  `Total` = c(\"a + b\", \"c + d\", \"n\", \"\")\n)\n\ncc_table |>\n  kable(escape = FALSE) |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">  </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Case (Disease) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Control (No Disease) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Total </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Exposed: Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> b </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a + b </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Exposed: No </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> c </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> d </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> c + d </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> **Total** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a + c </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> b + d </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> n </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Odds of exposure </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a / c </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> b / d </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Odds Ratio\n\nThe **odds ratio (OR)** gives an indication of the increased (or decreased) odds associated with exposure to the factor of interest.\n\n$$OR = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}$$\n\n| Odds Ratio | Interpretation |\n|------------|----------------|\n| **< 1** | A reduced odds of disease in the exposed group |\n| **= 1** | Odds is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups |\n| **> 1** | An increased odds of disease in the exposed group |\n\nAn odds ratio of one indicates that the odds is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups; an odds ratio greater than one indicates that the odds of disease is greater in the exposed group than in the unexposed group.\n\n## Worked Example: Oral Contraceptives and Breast Cancer\n\n\n::: {#tbl-oc-example .cell tbl-cap='Case-control study of oral contraceptives and breast cancer'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noc_table <- tibble(\n  `Oral contraceptives` = c(\"Ever used\", \"Never used\", \"**Total**\"),\n  `Case (Breast Cancer)` = c(\"537\", \"639\", \"**1176**\"),\n  `Control` = c(\"554\", \"622\", \"**1176**\")\n)\n\noc_table |>\n  kable(escape = FALSE) |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Oral contraceptives </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Case (Breast Cancer) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Control </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Ever used </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 537 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 554 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Never used </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 639 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 622 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> **Total** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> **1176** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> **1176** </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe cases were women recently diagnosed with breast cancer in a certain hospital.
