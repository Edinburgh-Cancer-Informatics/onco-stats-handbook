The hypothesis that \"All swans are white\" was assumed to be true but was rejected by the sighting of a black swan by Willem de Vlamingh in 1697. The black swan resulted in a rejection of the original null hypothesis (H~0~): \"All swans are white\" in favour of the alternative hypothesis (H~1~): \"All swans are not white\".\n\nStatistical inference follows a similar logical process. Having come up with a research question, the procedure is to:\n\n1. Collect data from a sample of individuals\n2. Formulate an appropriate null hypothesis\n3. Assume it to be true\n4. Seek evidence to refute it\n\n## The Null Hypothesis\n\nThe **null hypothesis**, H~0~, is a statement of 'no difference' or 'no effect' which is assumed to be true.\n\nFor example, in a clinical trial of a new drug for hypertension, the null hypothesis might be that the new drug has a similar average effect on blood pressure as another drug in current use – i.e. that there is no difference between the drugs.\n\n> H~0~: there is no difference in the effect on blood pressure between the two drugs\n\n## The Alternative Hypothesis\n\nThe **alternative hypothesis** (H~1~ or H~A~) is the negation of the null hypothesis. It holds if the null hypothesis is not true. The alternative hypothesis relates more directly to the theory we are interested in.\n\nIn the anti-hypertensive example, we might have:\n\n> H~1~: the effects of the two anti-hypertensive drugs are not equal\n\n## The Test Statistic and P-values\n\nHaving set up the null hypothesis, the probability that the observed data (or more extreme data) would be obtained if the null hypothesis were true is evaluated. This is done by calculating a numerical summary called a **test statistic** (calculated from the sample data) which is known to have a specific probability distribution.\n\nThe test statistic is used to test the null hypothesis. The value of the test statistic is related to the specific probability distribution to obtain a **P-value**. The smaller the P-value, the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\n## Using the P-value\n\nA **P-value less than 0.05** (p<0.05), is conventionally considered enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. P<0.05 suggests only a small chance that the observed results (or more extreme results) would have occurred if the null hypothesis were true.\n\nThe null hypothesis is then rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis and the results described as **statistically significant** at the 5% level.\n\nIn contrast, a **P-value equal to or greater than 0.05**, suggests insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is not rejected, and the results are described as **not statistically significant** at the 5% level.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Key Point\nThis does not mean that the null hypothesis is true - just that it cannot be rejected.\n:::\n\n## One or Two-tailed Test?\n\nIn the above example the alternative hypothesis did not specify the direction for the difference in the effects of the two anti-hypertensive medications, i.e. it did not state whether the new drug provides better blood pressure control than the current drug or vice versa.\n\nThis is known as a **two-tailed test** because it allows for either eventuality.\n\nIn some circumstances, a **one-tailed test** in which the direction of the difference is specified in H~1~ may be carried out. In general, one-tailed tests are discouraged as it is unlikely that we can know beforehand which direction will occur.\n\n## Making a Decision: Type I and Type II Errors\n\nA **Type I error** leads to the conclusion that an effect or relationship exists when in fact it does not. Type I errors result from the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis (a \"false positive\").\n\nA **Type II error** is a failure to detect an effect that is present. It results from incorrectly retaining a false null hypothesis (a \"false negative\").\n\n\n::: {#tbl-errors .cell tbl-cap='Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nerrors_table <- tibble(\n  ` ` = c(\"H₀ true\", \"H₀ false\"),\n  `Reject H₀` = c(\"Type I error\", \"No error (correct)\"),\n  `Do not reject H₀` = c(\"No error (correct)\", \"Type II error\")\n)\n\nerrors_table |>\n  kable() |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\")) |>\n  add_header_above(c(\" \" = 1, \"Decision\" = 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"empty-cells: hide;border-bottom:hidden;\" colspan=\"1\"></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:hidden;padding-bottom:0; padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px;text-align: center; \" colspan=\"2\"><div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 5px; \">Decision</div></th>\n</tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">  </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Reject H₀ </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Do not reject H₀ </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> H₀ true </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Type I error </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No error (correct) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> H₀ false </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No error (correct) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Type II error </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the previous example of a clinical trial of a new drug for hypertension:\n\n> H~0~: there is no difference in the effect on blood pressure between the two drugs\n>\n> H~1~: the effects of the two drugs on blood pressure are not equal\n\nA **Type I error** would occur if we concluded that the two drugs produced different effects when in fact there was no difference between them.\n\nA **Type II error** would occur if we failed to reject the null hypothesis when there was a real difference in effect of the two drugs.\n\n## Alpha, Beta, and Power\n\nThe probability of making a **Type I error** (denoted by **α** (alpha)) is simply the chosen significance level (conventionally 5%).\n\n$$\\text{Probability (Type I error)} = \\text{Probability (reject null when true)} = \\alpha$$\n\nThe chance of making a **Type II error** is denoted by **β** (beta):\n\n$$\\text{Probability (Type II error)} = \\text{Probability (fail to reject null when false)} = \\beta$$\n\nThe complement of β is (1-β). This is the probability of not making a Type II error:\n\n$$\\text{Probability (not Type II error)} = \\text{Probability (reject null when false)} = 1 - \\beta$$\n\n**(1 – β) is called the power of the test.** The power, therefore, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false; i.e. it is the chance (usually expressed as a percentage) of detecting, as statistically significant, a real treatment effect.\n\n## P-values or Confidence Intervals?\n\nWe saw earlier that a **confidence interval** is a range of values that the parameter of interest is likely to lie in the population. The parameter might be the population mean or median, or the mean difference between two groups, or a proportion.\n\nPresenting study findings directly as confidence intervals provides information on the imprecision due to sampling variability and has advantages over just giving P-values which dichotomise results into significant or non-significant.\n\nWith a confidence interval, we can determine whether a parameter is or is not likely to be different from something:\n\n- If the confidence interval **contains** a specific number (i.e. the number is between the lower and upper values of the interval), then there is **no evidence** that the parameter is different from that number\n- If the number is **not within** the interval, then there is **evidence** that the parameter is different from that number\n\n## Parametric Tests for Numeric Data\n\nIf data are numeric and come from a Normal distribution we can use **parametric tests** to test whether the population mean equals a specific value, or whether the means from two samples are equal.\n\nParametric tests need the assumption that the data derive from a Normal distribution. If this assumption cannot be met (even after transformation) then non-parametric tests must be used.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-parametric .cell tbl-cap='Parametric tests for Normally distributed data'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nparametric_tests <- tibble(\n  Situation = c(\"1 sample\", \"2 independent samples\", \"2 paired samples\"),\n  Test = c(\"Student's t-test\", \"Student's two-sample t-test\", \"Student's paired t-test\")\n)\n\nparametric_tests |>\n  kable() |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Situation </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Test </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 sample </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Student's t-test </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 independent samples </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Student's two-sample t-test </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 paired samples </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Student's paired t-test </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Non-parametric Tests for Numeric Data\n\n**Non-parametric tests** compare the median to a specific value, or test the medians between samples to see if they would be equal in the wider population.\n\nNon-parametric tests are not as powerful (i.e. the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false will be smaller) as parametric tests.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-nonparametric .cell tbl-cap='Non-parametric tests for non-Normally distributed data'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnonparametric_tests <- tibble(\n  Situation = c(\"1 sample\", \"2 independent samples\", \"2 paired samples\"),\n  Test = c(\"Wilcoxon signed rank test\", \"Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test\", \"Wilcoxon signed rank test, or paired sign test\")\n)\n\nnonparametric_tests |>\n  kable() |>\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Situation </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Test </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 sample </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Wilcoxon signed rank test </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 independent samples </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 paired samples </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Wilcoxon signed rank test, or paired sign test </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Tests for Categorical Data\n\nTests for categorical data are concerned with the comparisons of proportions in each category of a variable.

If a study has too few people, the power to detect a statistically significant effect will be low. On the other hand, obtaining a sample size that is large or larger than required can be difficult to achieve and expensive.\n\nRecruiting patients to a study which will be too small to detect the minimum effect we are looking for or recruiting more patients than necessary (over-powered) can be considered unethical.\n\n### Factors for Sample Size Calculation\n\nTo establish the sample size needed for a study the following factors should be considered:\n\n1. The minimum size of the effect to be detected\n2. The variability (standard deviation)\n3. The power required\n4. The significance level\n\nFor a chosen significance level, power, minimum size of effect to be detected and standard deviation, the sample size needed can be calculated.\n\n### General Principles\n\nPower is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In general:\n\n- As the **sample size increases**, the power **increases**\n- As the **variability (standard deviation) increases**, the power **decreases**\n- As the **minimum size of effect to be detected increases**, the power **increases** (i.e. small effects are more difficult to detect)\n\nTo increase the power of a study:\n\n- The sample size can be increased\n- The minimum size of the effect you are trying to detect can be increased\n\nThe significance level is not affected by choice of power or sample size. It is the decision rule that you employ in the study.\n\n## Summary\n\n| Concept | Definition |\n|---------|------------|\n| Null hypothesis (H~0~) | Statement of 'no difference' or 'no effect' |\n| Alternative hypothesis (H~1~) | Negation of the null hypothesis |\n| P-value | Probability of observed results if H~0~ is true |\n| Statistically significant | P < 0.05 (conventionally) |\n| Type I error (α) | Rejecting true H~0~ (\"false positive\") |\n| Type II error (β) | Failing to reject false H~0~ (\"false negative\") |\n| Power (1-β) | Probability of detecting a real effect |\n| Confidence interval | Range likely to contain population parameter |\n",
